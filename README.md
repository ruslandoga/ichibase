Learning by copying. (Almost) Everything I wanted to do in the past year in a single project.

What's copied:
- PostgREST-compatible API for SQLite3
- Supabase-compatible CDC notifications over Phoenix Channels
- Auth (sessions, JWT, passkey)
- Logs

What's new:
- Push notifications
- Simple CDC notifications over WS (no Phoenix)
- OpenTelemetry sink (similar to Baselime and Logfire)
- Performance analytics with DuckDB (similar to Livebook)
- Streaming backups of all data to object storage (similar to Litestream)
